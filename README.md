Stroke Data Analysis - Group Assignment

Objective

The groups' objective of this task is to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given dataset related to strokes.

Specific Objectives:
Identify Demographic Trends
Explore and analyze demographic factors such as age, gender, marital status, and residence type to identify any trends or patterns related to strokes.
Assess Health Metrics Impact
Investigate the impact of health metrics, including hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, and BMI, on the occurrence of strokes.
Evaluate Lifestyle Factors 
Examine lifestyle factors, specifically smoking status and work type, to understand their association with strokes.
Explore Correlations
Conduct correlation analysis to identify relationships between different health conditions (hypertension, heart disease) and understand their potential collective influence on strokes.

Dataset:
You are provided with a dataset containing information about individuals and their health status, with a focus on strokes. The dataset is contained here. The dataset is in tabular form and includes the following columns:
Data Dictionary:
id: Unique identifier for each individual.
gender: Gender of the individual (Male/Female).
age: Age of the individual.
hypertension: Indicates if the individual has hypertension (1: Yes, 0: No).
heart_disease: Indicates if the individual has heart disease (1: Yes, 0: No).
ever_married: Marital status.
work_type: Type of employment.
Residence_type: Type of residence  	
avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level in the blood.
bmi: Body Mass Index.
smoking_status: Smoking status.
stroke: Indicates if the individual had a stroke (1: Yes, 0: No).
Tasks
Data Loading
Data Inspection
Preview rows of the dataset to get a sense of its shape and structure.
Check for the data types of each column and handle any inconsistencies.
Check for missing values in each column.

Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values 
Check for and handle any duplicate rows.
Handle any outliers
Convert data types as needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Generate descriptive statistics for numerical columns (mean, median, std, etc.).
Explore the distribution of age, avg_glucose_level, and bmi.
Visualize the distribution of strokes in the dataset.
Analyze the distribution of gender, work_type, and smoking_status with respect to strokes.
Explore the correlation between hypertension, heart_disease, and strokes.
Identify and analyze any patterns or trends that might be interesting.
Use any tool i.e. groupby, pivot tables and crosstab to perform any additional analyses that you find relevant.

Summary and Insights
Summarize your findings and insights from the analysis.
Provide recommendations or further steps based on your analysis.

Deliverables
